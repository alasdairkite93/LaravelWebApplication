<h1>A simple web application to change unformatted data into an associative array</h1>

<p>To create the array simply write it as though it was a string:</p>
<i>action: Subtracted; quantity: 7; item_code: RNC1; product_name: Kids Basic T-shirt; colour: Denim Blue; size: 3-4y,</i>
<p>Use a comma to end the array, a semi-colon to seperate values and a colon to create a pair.</p?
